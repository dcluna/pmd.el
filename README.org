* Purpose

  Small package to automate the tedium of inserting debug-print statements in
  the code. It includes an interactive function that accepts a mini-language for
  printing multiple variables.

* Examples

  The command splits input whenever it sees a slash followed by a comma
  ("\,"). This is the default because the comma is significant in most languages
  (i.e., in Ruby, if you want to inspect an array like "[a,b,c]" as an unit, you
  don't want it to break on every comma).

  Use the modifier "ie" (for "ignore escape") to use the comma as a separator.
